The CMS is a giant detector that acts like a camera that "photographs" particle colicions, allowing us to interpret their nature.

Certainly we cannot observe the particles created in the collisions, but when they decompose they leave signals in the CMS subdetectors. These signals are used to "rebuild" the decomposition products, we call these "physical objects" and are stored in AOD files.

It is important to note that these reconstructed physical objects are included without verifying their "quality" since they are only interpretations of the signals observed by the CMS. That is, there are sources of uncertainty, such as efficiencies, misidentifications, etc.
