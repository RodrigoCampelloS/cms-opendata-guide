# Physics Objects

The CMS is a giant detector that acts like a camera that "photographs" particle collisions, allowing us to interpret their nature.

Certainly we cannot observe the particles created in the collisions, but when they decay they leave signals in the CMS subdetectors. These signals are used to "reconstruct" the decay products, we call these "physics objects" and are stored in AOD files.

It is important to note that these reconstructed physical objects are included without verifying their "quality" since they are only interpretations of the signals observed by the CMS. That is, there are sources of uncertainty, such as efficiencies, misidentifications, etc. For example, a reconstruct object like electron was not actually verified to be electron. To analyze only the "good quality" data, you must apply some selection criteria (next section).

## List of CMS physics objects 
Physical objects are organized through collections. For example, "electrons" have multiple collections and these differ according to the sequence that is required for their reconstruction.

- ### Electrons
- ### Photons 
- ### Muons
- ### Jets
- ### Missing transverse energy (MET)
- ### Taus
