#  Muons

The Physics Objects page shows you how to access muon collections in CMS, and which header files should be included in your C++ code in order to access all of their class information. On the Common Tools page you can find instructions to access all the basic kinematic information about any physics object.

## Installation

Detailed instructions on how to install the CERN virtual machines can be found in the [2010](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-virtual-machine-2010) and [2011/2012](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-virtual-machine-2011) virtual machine installation guides from the CERN Open Portal.  Choose the one to follow depending on the data release you will be working on.

In summary, the basic steps are as follows:

- Download and install the latest (or even better, the latest tested) version of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).  Note that it is available for an ample range of platforms.
- Download the **latest** CMS virtual image file.  Choose between [2010](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-virtual-machine-2010#downloading-and-creating-a-virtual-machine) or [2011/2012](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-virtual-machine-2011#downloading-and-creating-a-virtual-machine), depending on the data release of interest. Once downloaded, import the image file into VirtualBox.

    !!! Note "Remember"
        Always use the latest image file available for [2010](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/250) or [2011/2012](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/252). Older ones are usually deprecated.
