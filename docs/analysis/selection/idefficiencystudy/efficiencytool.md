# Efficiency Tools

For CMS efficiency using tag and probe, we developed two codes separatelly for each method presented: Sideband Subtraction method and Fitting method. Both codes can be found in this link:

* [Efficiency tools](https://github.com/allanjales/TagAndProbe/tree/master/efficiency_tools).

Both codes are explained in details in next sections splitted in *Sideband Subtraction Reference Guide (SB)* and *Fitting Method Reference Guide (Fit)*.

!!! Note
	In the guide we use *function(...)* in title when a function has arguments.

	Function with no arguments are written *function()* without "...".

## Workshop tutorial

Besides the references guide, there is a tutorial included in this guide that was used as a material for a workshop for theoretical physics.
