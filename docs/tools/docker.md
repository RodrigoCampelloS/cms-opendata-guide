# Docker

!!! Warning

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a commercial implementation
of a [container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container), a way to package
up a snapshot of everything needed to run some particular version
of software (OS, libraries, compilers, etc.). It is a very effective
way of interfacing with the CMS open data as it gives you the proper
environment you need to analyze these data.

To learn more about Docker in general, from a HEP perspective, you
may want to check out this
[Introduction to Docker](https://awesome-workshop.github.io/intro-to-docker/),
from Matthew Feickert.

You can find the list of Docker container images available for CMS open data
in [the guide page for CMS open data containers](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-guide-docker)
on the CERN Open data portal.
You can also jump right in with the most recent tutorial on
[the CMS open data containers](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-docker/).
