# Docker

!!! Warning

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a commercial implementation
of a [container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container), a way to package
up a snapshot of everything needed to run some particular version
of software (OS, libraries, compilers, etc.). It is a very effective
way of interfacing with the CMS open data as it gives you the proper
environment you need to analyze these data. 

To learn more about Docker in general, from a HEP perspective, you
may want to check out this
[Introduction to Docker](https://awesome-workshop.github.io/intro-to-docker/), 
from Matthew Feickert.
